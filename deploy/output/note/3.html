    <title>Armando Cordova: I joined my first Homebrew website and i</title>
    <meta name="description" content="I joined my first Homebrew website and indie web camp online meeting in general yesterday 😊 ([wiki](https://indieweb.org/events/2022-09-14-hwc-pacific)).

[Tracy](https://tracydurnell.com/) and [Angelo](https://ragt.ag/) were there, we discussed interesting topics and showed each other what we are working on. 
The direct benefits for my site have been:

* My website now uses [IndieAuth.com](https://indieweb.org/indieauth.com), [Aperture](https://aperture.p3k.io/) ([Microsub](https://indieweb.org/Microsub) server)
* Now I can use [Monocle](https://monocle.p3k.io/) and other Microsub clients
* I reactivated Webmention and tested they are working correctly with [Comment Parade](https://commentpara.de) (I am not publishing any Webmention yet)
* I added a Score section in my footer which shows a link and image taken from the page for my domain in [IndieWeb.rocks](https://indieweb.rocks)

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
More highlights of the meeting:
&lt;/summary&gt;

* Angelo's [the-street](https://indieweb.rocks/the-street) a way to give an address to domains inspired by Snow Crash. I will add bellow my interpretation and derived ideas:
    * The address is a domain hash, a lot of hashes will not point to an active domain
    * To solve this issue lists of addresses can be created. 'the-street' is one such list
    * I imagine that these lists could be navigated similar to webrings
    * All sorts of visualizations could be created as well (from street representations to plotting in a graph)
    * Address list could also be merged to display my own personal list of all the websites I share a community with
    * I could even see how many communities do I share with one or another domain
    * Any plain old links page/blogroll could be enhanced with a visualization, the actual hash can be hidden from view
    * A (separate?) path hash could help us map out people located on shared services such as Known
* Discussed with Tracy and Angelo about pop-ins, personas, online meetings and collaboration.
* Learnt about [https://www.gather.town/](https://www.gather.town/) dynamic videocall rooms with 2D videogame controls. Free up to 25 people at a time 
* Learnt about whostyle, a way to have a say on how the reader will display your mf2 content and it's complications
* Proposed &quot;alternate embed&quot; or &quot;alternate embeddable&quot; that would point to an embed friendly version of your page. This should be more powerful than whostyle and easier to implement (I assume)
&lt;/details&gt;

Looking forward to joining more meetings!
