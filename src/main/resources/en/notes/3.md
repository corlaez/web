I joined my first Homebrew website and indie web camp online meeting in general yesterday ðŸ˜Š ([wiki](https://indieweb.org/events/2022-09-015-hwc-pacific)).

[Tracy](https://tracydurnell.com/) and [Angelo](https://ragt.ag/) were there, we discussed interesting topics and showed each other what we are working on. 
The direct benefits for my site have been:

* My website now uses [IndieAuth.com](https://indieweb.org/indieauth.com), [Aperture](https://aperture.p3k.io/) ([Microsub](https://indieweb.org/Microsub) server)
* Now I can use [Monocle](https://monocle.p3k.io/) and other Microsub clients
* I reactivated Webmention and tested they are working correctly with [Comment Parade](https://commentpara.de) (I am not publishing any Webmention yet)
* I added a Score section in my footer which shows a link and image taken from the page for my domain in [IndieWeb.rocks](https://indieweb.rocks)

* Angelo's [the-street](https://indieweb.rocks/the-street) a way to give an address to domains inspired by Snow Crash. I will add bellow my interpretation and derived ideas:
    * The address is a domain hash, a lot of hashes will not point to an active domain
    * To solve this issue lists of addresses can be created. 'the-street' is one such list
    * I imagine that these lists could be navigated similar to webrings
    * All sorts of visualizations could be created as well (from street representations to plotting in a graph)
    * Address list could also be merged to display my own personal list of all the websites I share a community with
    * I could even see how many communities do I share with one or another domain
    * Any plain old links page/blogroll could be enhanced with a visualization, the actual hash can be hidden from view
    * A (separate?) path hash could help us map out people located on shared services such as Known
* Discussed with Tracy and Angelo about pop-ins, personas, online meetings and collaboration.
* Learnt about [https://www.gather.town/](https://www.gather.town/) dynamic videocall rooms with 2D videogame controls. Free up to 25 people at a time 
* Learnt about whostyle, a way to have a say on how the reader will display your mf2 content and it's complications
* Proposed "alternate embed" or "alternate embeddable" that would point to an embed friendly version of your page. This should be more powerful than whostyle and easier to implement (I assume)

Looking forward to joining more meetings!
