I had a good weekend at the beach and I just learnt about two interesting developments:

1. [Alistair Cockburn](https://alistaircockburn.com/), [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/) cosigner and creator of [Hexagonal Architecture](https://hexagonalarchitecture.org/) has created a website for his architecture. He also requested feedback before that, so I am curious of how the site evolves (for now it is a collection of explanations which is already a great start)
2. [htmx](https://htmx.org/)'s [discord server](https://htmx.org/discord) added a [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) channel after my suggestion on the java channel, there is interest for a blog/example.
