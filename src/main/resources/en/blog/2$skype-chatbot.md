"Daniel en mi piso" (Daniel in my floor) was a Skype bot that I made for my coworkers when I worked at Bellatrix. Daniel came every day selling delicious home-made sandwiches.
He stayed a few minutes outside each floor with Bellatrix offices and other companies. However, we would have to step out at the right time to catch him, or we would miss him.

The bot was meant to Announce when Daniel arrives to your floor. You subscribe to a given floor, and when the bot is notified that Daniel is in a given floor, you receive a message and a notification.
The simple program relied on trust and accurate reports of its participants to work, but it was a fun experiment to run. The bot is deployed but deactivated
