# Board

## Personal note without date or history

board and legal should not be h-entry

### Tools
* https://app.asqatasun.org/ A
* https://validator.w3.org/ no issues
* https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/  No Error Found. CSS level 3 + SVG
* https://indiewebify.me/validate-h-entry/ works!
* granary.io/ I can use it to generate RSS from my h-feeds

### Ideas
* Categories as digital garden curation
* Articles should only show translation links if the translation exists
(complicates logic, it removes pressure for me to translate to Spanish but allows slowly adding other langs)
* implement first microformars-jvm parser with https://jsoup.org/
* use https://prismjs.com/ for syntax highlight NEW plugin
* use theme colors in css
* pure css dark/light mode https://www.jobsity.com/blog/how-to-make-dark-mode-for-websites-using-only-css NEW
* replace the banner with a solid color at least for og (linked in has aggressive compression) LinkedIn compat
* Improve contrast in favicons (lighter red? white font?)
