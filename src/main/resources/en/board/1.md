# Board

## Personal note without date or history

board and legal should not be h-entry

add send me a message via https://commentpara.de/ on footer (maybe as part of webmentions pluginkldf)

rel-feed was a proposal for linking to multiple (potentially alternative) h-feeds from a site's homepage, which was adding extra work & complexity to existing feed discovery methods, and has been superceded with re-using rel-alternate with type=text/mf2+html to link to h-feed files. https://indieweb.org/rel-feed

### Ideas
* Categories as digital garden curation
* Articles should only show translation links if the translation exists
(complicates logic, it removes pressure for me to translate to Spanish but allows slowly adding other langs)
* implement first microformars-jvm parser with https://jsoup.org/
* use https://prismjs.com/ for syntax highlight NEW plugin
* use theme colors in css
* pure css dark/light mode https://www.jobsity.com/blog/how-to-make-dark-mode-for-websites-using-only-css NEW
* replace the banner with a solid color at least for og (linked in has aggressive compression) LinkedIn compat
* Improve contrast in favicons (lighter red? white font?)
* add external rels to markdown links
