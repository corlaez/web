However, this is served through your ISP which may be monitoring and collecting your data. Additionally, I am hosting my
website in [render.com](https://render.com), and they do perform some forms of tracking and data sharing as they explain
on [their privacy policy](https://render.com/privacy). They do not share any data of my visitors to me, the only data
they share is a timeline of bandwidth consumed with no further breakdown of location or IP or individual visitors whatsoever
(this doesn't mean they don't have this data, they may).
